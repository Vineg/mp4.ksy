This is a Kaitai Struct implementation of parsing the ISO Base Media File Format.

It is _very_ incomplete, and created to get at one specific piece of metadata,
but might be useful for future investigations, so I'm saving off the current progress.

Contributions of missing info are still welcome. :)
